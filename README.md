# The Random Blog Wall

## Summary

This app is a simple blog that uses firebase to store and modify posts by anonymous users and react displays the posts in a somewhat random order.

## Build

This app was built with React as the front-end and Firebase-Firestore to handle the back-end. Jest was used to help test components of the application.

### Final Comments and Notes

-- The form is awkwardly placed and should be sticky...  

-- The app wierdly deforms when put on a small screen...
